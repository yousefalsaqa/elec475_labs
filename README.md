## ðŸš€ Project Highlights

### 1. SnoutNet: Pet Nose Localization
- Developed a custom neural network called **SnoutNet** for localizing pet noses in images using the **Oxford-IIIT Pet Noses Dataset**.
- Implemented data augmentation strategies to improve model performance.
- Achieved benchmark performance with fine-tuning techniques.

### 2. Data Augmentation and Preprocessing
- Utilized techniques like resizing, random flips, and color jittering to improve dataset robustness.
- Designed pipelines for seamless integration with machine learning models.
